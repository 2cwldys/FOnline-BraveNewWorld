# 	{4} is a header type, pip-boy will use this before every entry, if %d then a nr will be added. 
# 	It was used by old behaviour, where previous quest steps were saved.
#	Now it wcan be used to add some text before the quest header.
#
#	{5} is used to add text before the quest body. Used to format spacing between header and body.

{4}{}{%d. }
{5}{}{

Current progress:

# Number
# Name

#
# Number formula:
#	Quest Progress:	VariableId * 1000 + Value (1-100) - The text that appears at a given value of the variable (current objective / body).
#	Quest Tab:		VariableId * 1000 + 101 - Name of quest tab. 
#	Quest Info:		VariableId * 1000 + 102 - Permanent quest description. (info/header, right after {4})
#
#	Notes:
#		Setting a variable to VariableID * 1000 + 000 will remove the entry from Pip-boy. This can be used to remove tutorial quests for example, when leaving tutorial zone (Landers Point phase 1)

#		- Should containt location if that is known before every quest. Pip-boy will sort alphabetically, thus quest group will form naturally.
#
#	Quest Info (102):

#			- 'JOB:' denotes a repeatable task. If the task is completed or failed, it can be attempted at a later time.
#			- 'STORY:' denotes important or main story lines, for example Vault 24 quest.
#			- 'QUEST:' denotes everything else, it can be ommited and Quest Tracker will default to this, but I have added it for clarity.
#
#	Quest Progress (1-100):
#		- Following keywords can be added to be processed by Quest Tracker (note that ':' is part of the keyword)
#			- 'HIDDEN:' progress will not appear in Pip-boy or Quest Tracker. (used if code cycles through values that do not have entry, otherwise Pip-boy would show 'error' as description)
#			- 'NO_POPUP:' progress will not appear in Pip-boy or Quest Tracker. (to suppress some quest changes, if they would pop up too offten, ex: while in dialog mode fast progressing quests)
#			- 'DONE:' quest is ready, player can go back to quest giver to get rewards. (ex: kill dogs quest, show player all dogs are dead and they can leave are)
#			- 'SOFT_FAILED:' quest failed but can be attempted again at a later time. 
#			- 'HARD_FAILED:' quest failed for good and cannot be attempted later.
#			- 'SOFT_COMPLETED:' quest completed and can be re-taken at a later time. (ex: JOB: type of tasks/quests)
