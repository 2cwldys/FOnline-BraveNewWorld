# FOClassic + PReloaded + Brave New World update

| | FOClassic | PReloaded | Brave New World update |
|:----------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:------------------:|
| Description |Based on Fallout Online engine which became open source a few years ago. Most used revision was taken and improved by Rotators.  | A simplified version of Reloaded Season 3 as an example to use as test or integrate FOclassic into existing repos. | New features for the previous two, code fixes or improvements both to engine and scripts. |
| Aim | The purpose of this was to determined before FOnline becoming open source, probably to help existing servers with bug fixes, patches. | For testing and ease of access to a working FOclassic engine/server/client bundle. | Further updates and fixes in an independent way, the aim was to publish separate tags with easy diffs as usable parts. |
| License | GPL3 | IDK | If you use these patches together with the other two, then those licenses take priority, otherwise do what you want with it. |
